# Filtered_MSA_SARS_CoV_2
There is one .pdf file and 3 file folds included. 
Each fold for a genome sequences data-set collected from GISAID database till the date indicated by the fold name.
There are 6 files included in each fold. One .png file,  one .xls file and four .mat files. 
The .png file shows the top 100 significant pairwise PLM scores. The links beween/to the non-coding region are discarded in the circos plot. The greys for the links with PLM scores located in top 51 to 100. The red and blue are for top 50s while red for close links (the distance between loci is less than 4), blue for far links.
The .xls file presents the rank, protein, type of mutations for each terminal of pairwise links as well as the indice of locus in the reference sequence "Wuhan-Hu-1" (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947).
Other .mat files are full header files, filtered headers, filtered and mapped MSA files ('-NACGT' ---> '012345') , remainning loci indices with respect to the reference sequences respectively.
